# Floodcontrol
**Under construction!**
Pretty much unusable right now.

A really basic [Pixelflut](https://github.com/defnull/pixelflut) client.
Work in progress, my improve on future chaos events.

## Installation
Just clone the repo and `cargo run` it!

## Usage

    floodgate <image> <target> [x] [y]
  
To send pixels somewhere, you need to specify a path to the image and a network address of the Pixelflut server.
Optionally, you can add x and y offsets, so your image does not end up in the top left corner.
